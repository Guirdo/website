This local business contact a colleague and me to develop a landing page, in order to generate more trust to their clients. 

We set a death line of two weeks and we always kept in touch with these business women telling them about our progress and asking them their feedback about our decisions. 

## Tech stack

- **ReactJS :** We took advantage of a component structure in order to reuse code.

## Designing

We took inspiration from other similar companies' pages, and for the copy of the page they gave us a document and we also added our suggestions. 

About the color palette, we extracted from their logo with Color Adobe.

## What I learned from this project

For this project I needed to learn new things:

- How to explain technical concepts to my clients in a simple way and how this is really important for conveying security to them. 
- How to optimize the meta data from the page in order to improve its ranking in the search engine results.
- Optimization of the images, with the format ```.webp``` that browsers prefer. 
- Management of client's data and hosting services.
