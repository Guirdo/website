This project was part of my mentoring sessions in <a href="https://www.codygos.com/" target="_blank">Codygos</a>. My mentor showed me the Gutendex API, y for this challenge he asked me to implement things I never tried before and with the basic technologies, without any framework or library, unless it was necessary for the 2-week period for handing it.

In the end of the first stage, he asked to do a couple of unit and end-to-end tests with cypress.

## Design

First, I started with design part of the page and then to start with the marking up.

## Features

* **Searching of books by author, title, topic and language:** it also posible to filter between the original source that is online and the local one.
*  **Results' pagination:** resulted books from the searching are showed inside cards with their basic information, as well as with a button for reading it online and another one for downloading it in ```.epub``` format.
* **Record of user's behavior:** in the dashboard page it will be the times users have searched books, showing graphs for searchings by author and by topics, and how many books they have added.
* **Local library:** user can add their own books which will be save in the local storage of the browser.

## What I learned from this project

* To use and set eslint and stylelint.
* To implement pagination for the searching results.
* To implement end-to-end tests with Cypress, and to configure it.
